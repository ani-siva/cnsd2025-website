# Website for CNSD 2025

Minimalistic website that I designed for the Conference on Nonlinear Systems and Dynamics held at Bharathidasan University from 10th - 13th March 2025. 

Website is very bare-bones and I have only stuck to using HTML and CSS with no javascript and bootstrap. This repo will also act as my testing ground for my webdev work.
